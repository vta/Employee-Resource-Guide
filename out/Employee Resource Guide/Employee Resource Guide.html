It is intended to serve as the permanent reference and working guide for employees in the daily administration of Authority affairs.</p>\n<p>These written policies are intended to increase understanding, eliminate the need for numerous personal or individual decisions on matters of Authority policy, and assist in assuring uniformity throughout the organization.</p>\n<p>This manual covers all Authority employees except where an employee's collective bargaining agreement addresses the same policy. In all occasions, the collective bargaining agreement and/or applicable resolution will supersede the policies presented in this manual. These policies and procedures do not supersede any work rules established by the individual departments.</p>\n<p>Unrepresented employees are subject to the terms and conditions contained in the benefits resolution.
